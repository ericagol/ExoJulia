A 20% deviation requires a source that is smaller than
about ~2.5 R_E.  This corresponds to ~6 R_sun at 8kpc
(Earth-mass lens at 5 kpc).  So, giant stars will show
deviations that are too small to be easily detectable
with microlensing.  A space telescope is necessary to
resolve the main-sequence stars which are small enough
in angular size to detected lensing by Earth-sized
planets (or smaller): 2002ApJ...574..985B
The problem is confusion:  from the ground, atmospheric
seeing causes stars to be blended towards the galactic
center.  Since giant stars are so much more luminous,
it becomes impossible to do photometry of the main-sequence
stars.

Note that magnification is the ratio of the flux received
with the lens to the flux received without the lens. To
compute magnification of a finite size source requires
averaging the magnification map over the size of the
source.
