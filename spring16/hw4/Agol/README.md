This code searches for a 3rd planet in a system with
two transiting planets.  Here is an example of calling it:

par_mcmc,chi_mcmc = fit_mysteryplanet3()

You have to hit return a few times after plots are made.
The whole code takes about 5 hours to run.

The plot Jupiter_detection.png  shows the detection
of Jupiter near its correct period with the TTVs of
Earth & Venus.

The plot ttv_earth_venus.png shows the TTVs of Venus
& Earth with the best-fit model for the 3 planets
using TTVFaster.
