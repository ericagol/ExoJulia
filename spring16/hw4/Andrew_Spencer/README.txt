Hi Eric!

We failed to make this work as expected, although everything RUNS. There is something wrong with what we pass to curvefit or how we handle the model function, since we can't seem to retrieve reasonable parameters.

The seperate HW4 files for Spencer and Andrew were just our own separate attempts to make this work.

You'll see 00.txt files, which are histograms of each of the 15 parameters for an MCMC run.
